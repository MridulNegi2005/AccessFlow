# AccessFlow shared agent log

Shared project context for Claude Code, Codex and Antigravity. Personal knowledge is
not copied into this repository. Canonical plan and interface copies are in artifacts/.

## [2026-09-13 14:30] — Codex
**Task:** Implement AccessFlow; prioritize independent teammate bootstrap.
**Changes:** Added contracts/interfaces, deterministic fakes, clock, initial unverified engine,
Python configuration, workstream ownership, handoff instructions and plan copy. Initialized sync.
**Status:** in-progress
**Notes:** Atishay may begin B against contracts and fakes. Engine is not yet safety-tested.
Official kit, live model benchmarks and final submission remain outstanding. No hosted remote.

## [2026-09-13 14:32] — Codex
**Task:** Prepare GitHub collaboration at user request.
**Changes:** Added initial engine safety tests; normal clone/push instructions replace bundle workflow.
**Status:** in-progress
**Notes:** 16 offline tests passed; Ruff passed. Authenticated GitHub account verified; repository visibility selection pending. No live inference claim.

## [2026-09-13 15:00] — Codex
**Task:** Prepare the public-repository handoff for Atishay.
**Changes:** Verified the public clone and `atishay/perception` checkout; corrected
`ATISHAY_START_HERE.md` to explain direct collaborator pushes versus fork-based work.
**Status:** handoff-ready; no Workstream B implementation started.
**Notes:** `uv run --python 3.12 --extra dev pytest tests/test_contract.py` passed 4 tests.
The default 3.11 `uv` target is locally broken; no live ASR, vision or hosted-backend
evidence exists.

## [2026-09-13 15:30] - Codex
**Task:** Implement the first turn-policy checkpoint for Atishay's Workstream B.
**Changes:** Added the synchronous `HeuristicTurnPolicy` and focused tests for partial speech,
corrections, repetitions, backchannels and stale revisions; updated the README and handoff.
**Status:** checkpoint validated; no vision or UI implementation yet.
**Notes:** `uv run --python 3.12 --extra dev pytest -q` passed 29 tests and Ruff passed for owned
paths. The current contract still lacks timer/silence events, so no acoustic pause claim is made.
